Java - Lecture 1 - May 16

Program = set of instructions
machine needs to understande with the help of program - programming languages

computer understand binary language (10)

we are not able to understand the ninary language so thats why programming language

low level language - binary
hight lever - english (all programming language)

there should be conversion from high level to low level language from compiler

interpeter - execute line by line while typing - python, js
compiler - executes the set of instructions, it generates the output, also check the errors 

C# - .exe file
java - .class file

java is platform (OS) independent - one code can run on different platform with some low lever languae

why java is platform independent:

JDK - Java Development Kit = provides facility to run the the code (compiler is part of JDK)
JRE - JAVA Runtime Enviroment = Java Virtual Machine: run our output on JVM (JRE is not contain the compiler)

JRE is only run the java code not compile
JDK is compile the code and then run coz JDK contains JRE
Customer get the JRE only not JDK

I generator the .class/byte code and then it compile by JDK and the JRE runs the code so thats why it is platform independent because for every OS has different JDK and JRE
.class(byte code) (our code) runs by the JVM only

My code talks to JVM (as specific for the OS) and JVM talks to OS

JVM is different for every platform
