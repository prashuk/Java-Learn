The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l-1.

Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1.

In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  ⌈ Log2(N+1) ⌉   

A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least   ⌈ Log2L ⌉ + 1   levels

In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
