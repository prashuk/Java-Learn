Similar to HashMap, but maintains only keys, not pair

duplicate values are not allowed

Objects that you insert in HashSet are not guaranteed to be inserted in same order. Objects are inserted based on their hash code

Set<String> h = new HashSet<String>();
Iterator<String> i = h.iterator(); 
while (i.hasNext()) 
     System.out.println(i.next());
