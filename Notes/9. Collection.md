The Collection interface (**java.util.Collection**) and Map interface (**java.util.Map**) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.

Before Collection Framework (or before JDK 1.2) was introduced, the standard methods for grouping Java objects (or collections) were Arrays or Vectors or Hashtables.

As we can see, none of these collections (Array, Vector or Hashtable) implement a standard member access interface. It was very difficult for programmers to write algorithms that can work for all kinds of Collections.

Consistent API : The API has a basic set of interfaces like Collection, Set, List, or Map. All classes (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, etc) that implement these interfaces have *some* common set of methods.

**Hierarchy of Collection Framework**

             Collection                Map
         /     /    \      \            |
        /      /      \     \           |

The **AbstractCollection** class in Java is a part of the [Java Collection Framework](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/) and implements the *Collection interface*



```java
import java.util.*; 
import java.util.AbstractCollection; 
  
public class GFG { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        AbstractCollection<Object> abs = new ArrayList<Object>(); 
  
        // Use add() method to add 
        abs.add("Welcome"); 
        abs.add("To"); 
        abs.add("Geeks"); 
        abs.add("4"); 
        abs.add("Geeks"); 
  
        // Displaying the Collection 
        System.out.println("AbstractCollection: " + abs); 
    } 
} 
Output:
AbstractCollection: [Welcome, To, Geeks, 4, Geeks]
```
